# Snake-Ruby

I recently started expiremening with Ruby and had a lot of fun with it.
This is my first ever Ruby project where I used Ruby2D for the graphics.
The code is a little bit messy since I wanted to try things as I learned about them,
that's why there's a huge usage of lambda functions in the game.rb for example.
I may come back to this project and clean things up, but for now I am happy that it works like a classic snake game!
